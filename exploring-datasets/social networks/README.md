# Social Network Datas
There are 50,000 posts in this data set from an Iranian social network(**Cafejomle**). Posts are divided into three files so that the size of the files is not large.
This dataset contains three properties: user_id, date, and post text. 
## Tips on this data:

*   The user_id column is hashed user username (for privacy).
*   The text column of the post is encoded in base64 and you have to decode it before using it.
*   Each post contains a maximum of 400 characters.
*   No preprocessing was performed on the data.
